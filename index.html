          For the purposes of ECE 499 offered by the UVic Electrical and Computer Engineering department, our team of
          four students have been tasked with
          designing a project that identifies a real world problem and provide a solution to it. The project was to be
          designed and implemented over the course of the
          Summer 2023 semester.

        <h3 class="secondhead"> Our Idea </h3>
        <p class="para">
          With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the latter half of 2019, populated locations have been adopting a safety first approach in managing the spread of contagious diseases. 

          The emergence of this highly contagious virus has exposed the vulnerabilities in our existing public health infrastructure and underscored the importance of proactive 
          measures to manage infectious diseases effectively. As densely populated areas continue to be hubs for social and economic activities, ensuring the safety and well-being 
          of communities in these spaces has become a paramount concern. Traditional methods of manual temperature checks and symptom screenings are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, 
          and prone to human error.
          <br><br>
          This project aims to help address this issue by implementing a simple, yet effective technology to help identify sick individuals.  
          This seamless integration of facial tracking and temperature monitoring will enable a swift and accurate assessment of individuals 
          as they pass through designated checkpoints or areas of interest.
          <br><br>

          Our aim is to offer an additional layer of protection to populated locations, effectively improving their ability to manage and mitigate contagious disease outbreaks. 
          Early detection of individuals with elevated temperatures can help prevent potential disease transmission, allowing for timely isolation and medical intervention when necessary. 
          Moreover, the system's non-invasive and discreet nature ensures a user-friendly experience, avoiding unnecessary discomfort for the public while fostering compliance with 
          health and safety protocols.
          <br><br>

          The final product will be made accordingly in consideration with the monetary and time constraints of this course. Through this endeavor, we aim to provide communities 
          with an easy-to-deploy and reliable tool to enhance public health surveillance, and foster a safer environment for all.

        </p>
        <p class="para">
          The team has come up with the following ideas to address this problem: <br><br>
          On the hardware side of things, a physical contraption will be built consisting of a MEMS Thermal Sensor, a
          few servo motors, a 1080p Webcam,
          a Raspberry Pi Model 4B, a distance sensor, and a Liquid Crystal Display. For the software implementation,
          Python3 along with the
          OpenCV library will be used to control the apparatus.
