          For the purposes of ECE 499 offered by the UVic Electrical and Computer Engineering department, our team of
          four students have been tasked with
          designing a project that identifies a real world problem and provide a solution to it. The project was to be
          designed and implemented over the course of the
          Summer 2023 semester.

        <p class="para">
          With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the latter half of 2019, highly frequented and populated locations have
          been adopting a safety
          first approach in managing the spread of contagious diseases. This project aims to help address this issue by
          implementing a simple,
          yet effective technology to help identify sick individuals.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          The team has come up with the following ideas to address this problem: <br><br>
          On the hardware side of things, a physical contraption will be built consisting of a MEMS Thermal Sensor, a
          few servo motors, a 1080p Webcam,
          a Raspberry Pi Model 4B, a distance sensor, and a Liquid Crystal Display. For the software implementation,
          Python3 along with the
          OpenCV library will be used to control the apparatus.
          <br><br>
          The final product will be made accordingly in consideration with the monetary and time constraints of this
          course. The eventual goal of this
          project is to create a mechanism that is easy to deploy at the entrances of densely populated areas for
          temperature tracking. With accurate
          measurements, it becomes easier to filter out individuals who display an abnormal forehead temperature reading
          signifying a high chance of being contagious.
