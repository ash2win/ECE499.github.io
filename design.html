              The Omron D6T-8L-09 digital infrared thermometer was chosen for this project. This sensor works by continuously 
              detecting radiant infrared energy and computing a temperature value from this. This is much better for our 
              application than other non-contact thermometers like Pyroelectric sensors as they can only detect temperature 
              changes and will not output a continuous and accurate temperature reading.
              <br><br>
              The viewing angles of the sensor are respectively:
              <ul>
                <li>X direction: 54.5°</li>
                <li>Y direction: 5.5°</li>
              </ul>
