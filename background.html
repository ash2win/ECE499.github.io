        Literature Study
      </h3>
      <p class = "para">
        As technology advances further, leading researchers and scientists have continually developed new technologies to counter emerging 
        viral diseases and illnesses. These technologies have been fundamental in preventing the spread of viral illnesses especially in 
        densely populated areas by providing a means of detecting carriers before they are able to come into contact with other individuals. 
        The following section of this report will focus on discussing various technologies that have been implemented in the past and how they 
        compare to the project developed for ECE 499  in terms of various metrics such as cost, ease of implementation, etc.

        Social Impact and Targeted Demographic
      </h3>
      <p class="para">
        The social impact of this project includes the improved health and welfare of communities due to better  disease protection. However, if this design does not 
        work correctly, it has the potential to encourage the spread of illness. As a result, some relevant principles from the code of ethics of EGBC for this design 
        are the first and sixth points. To hold paramount the safety and health of the public as well as providing accurate information to individuals. To uphold these 
        principles, the information on human temperature must be correct so as to maintain the publicâ€™s safety. 
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        The targeted demographic and user base includes locations of high and constantly moving population density that can include hospitals, airports, schools, and public libraries. 
        This technology would also add value to any closed indoor space but is generally more effective for places that experience a constant stream of people. With social distancing 
        being highly improbable and ineffective to properly follow in cramped spaces such as airplanes and public transport, accurate temperature tracking can help mitigate the spread 
        of diseases.
