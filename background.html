        The social impact of this project includes the improved health and welfare of communities due to better  disease protection. However, if this design does not 
        work correctly, it has the potential to encourage the spread of illness. As a result, some relevant principles from the code of ethics of EGBC for this design 
        are the first and sixth points. To hold paramount the safety and health of the public as well as providing accurate information to individuals. To uphold these 
        principles, the information on human temperature must be correct so as to maintain the publicâ€™s safety.

      <p>
        The targeted demographic and user base includes locations of high and constantly moving population density that can include hospitals, airports, schools, and public libraries. 
        This technology would also add value to any closed indoor space but is generally more effective for places that experience a constant stream of people. With social distancing 
        being highly improbable and ineffective to properly follow in cramped spaces such as airplanes and public transport, accurate temperature tracking can help mitigate the spread 
        of diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final product will be made accordingly in consideration with the monetary and time constraints of this course. The eventual goal of this 
        project is to create a mechanism that is easy to deploy at the entrances of densely populated areas for temperature tracking.  With accurate 
        measurements, it becomes easier to filter out individuals who display an abnormal forehead temperature reading signifying a high chance of being contagious.
